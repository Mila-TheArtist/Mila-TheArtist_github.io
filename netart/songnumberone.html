<h1><center>Into The Unknown & Can't Stop Singing</center></h1>
<p>
 As soon as Lily heard alarm clock go off the next day, she thought that since no one knows what's going to happen on any given day, she decided the best song to start off with would be Into The Unknown from Frozen II.

 And she started to sing her heart out!

After Lily stopped singing, her mom and dad heard everything, and asked her, "why are you singing so early in the morning?"
Now she could've just explained to them in a simple answer, but instead she thought she'd sing, Can't Stop Singing from Teen Beach Movie. Then afterwards she'll give them a note explaining everything.
