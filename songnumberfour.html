<h1><center>The Math Song</center></h1>
<p>
 So far Lily, hasn't gotten the opportunity to sing in class, to her relief.
<br>However, she didn't realize what her math teacher, Mr. Tangent, was about to ask her.
<br> 
"Lily, can you tell me what your opinion on mathematics is?" 
</p>
<br>
<p>
"Well..., Lily started."
<br>
Then she thought about the math song from the School of Rock film:

<p>
After class, Mr. Tangent called Lily over to his desk, and said,
<br>
"Lily, I wanted to say that was an interesting take on math, you did a great job!"
<br>
"Thank you Mr. Tangent," Lily said. 
<br>
After that success, Lily was confident about her next challenge... the cafeteria.
