<h1>The One Day Singing Challenge</h1>
<p>
 Not to long ago there was this girl named, Lily; since she loved singing so much, her friends thought it would be fun to challenge her to sing for one day.
 They stated that throughout the course of one day whenever she has to talk to someone or answer a question, she needs to express her feelings through song.
 And no matter how long the song is, she has to sing the whole thing.
 Seeing how this would be a fun and unique challenge for her, Lily confidently accepted it! 
 Starting tomorrow, she will sing the day away!
